## Introduction
This project is Restful API that used [NestJs](https://docs.nestjs.com/) as engine. NestJs is [NodeJs Framework](https://nodejs.org/en/) a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports TypeScript (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming). <br>

*You can read more about NestJs by visit their website if necessary (https://docs.nestjs.com/).*

#### This project will follow this instruction

[x]	Order transaction involves the following actors: customer and admin.

[x]	Product dictionary â†’ free to define product metadata and values as necessary, can be hardcoded,
	1. Product has quantity; product with quantity 0 can not be ordered

[x]	Order transaction process flow and verification; single transaction has the following steps:

## Prerequisites
We must to install some component to run this project
1. [NestJs](https://docs.nestjs.com/)
2. [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/) and [MongoDb Client](https://robomongo.org/)
3. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
4. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
5. Git - [Window](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux), [Mac](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)


## How to
Step by step implementation
1. Install *Docker* and *Docker Compose*, you can follow the step from [docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and this for [docker compose docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. Copy or move `config-example.yml` to `config.yml` in root dir of project.
3. Run bash script to up Docker Service `docker-compose up` or `docker-compose down` to take down Docker Service.
4.  _**THIS MIGRATE FOR INITIAL PROJECT**_ - Migrate Database `docker exec -it ack yarn migrate`, if you want to rollback run `docker exec -it ack yarn migrate:rollback`

## Test Project
After run the project, we must to check project is running well or not. 

*We gonna check with hit endpoint test*

#### Test endpoint
Assume our endpoint in `localhost:3000`
- Url `localhost:3000/api/hello`
- Method `GET`
- Url Params `null`
- Body `null`
- Header `not need credentials`
```
- Code: 200
- Body: 
{
	"statusCode": 200,
	"message": "This is test endpoint."
}
```

## Credentials
Credentials for this project
#### Database
```
- Database Name: ack
- User: ack
- Password: ack123
```
#### App
```
- Host: localhost
- Port: 3000
```
## Endpoint
All endpoints in [akar-init.collection.json](akar-init.collection.json). If we want to use json file, we must import to Postman back. [Follow this step for import into Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/)
